# Friendfeed Application Example (FFTop20)

This is a rewritten source, that lays out the basic format for an application
using ffv2lib. It is the majority of the code behind Friendfeed Top 20(http://twentyfivehourlabs.com/friendfeed/top/index.php).

The original app was built as a way to test ffv2lib.

### Structural components

This application uses ffv2lib, for requests with OAuth signing and Skeleton as a responsive UI framework. For more info on these:
